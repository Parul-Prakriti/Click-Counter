# Tally-Counter

My first Android app. It is a simple application which counts the number of times the button is pressed and shows it on the app screen.

## What is a tally counter?
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tally_counter):

A tally counter is a mechanical, electronic, or software device used to incrementally count something, typically fleeting. One of the most common things tally counters are used for is counting people, animals, or things that are quickly coming and going from some location.
